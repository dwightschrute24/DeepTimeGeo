> **<p align="justify"> Abstract:** Human trajectory data produced by daily mobile devices has proven  its usefulness in various substantial fields such as urban planning  and epidemic prevention. In terms of the individual privacy concern,  human trajectory simulation has attracted increasing attention from  researchers, targeting at offering numerous realistic mobility data  for downstream tasks. Nevertheless, the prevalent issue of data  scarcity undoubtedly degrades the reliability of existing deep learn-  ing models. In this paper, we are motivated to explore the intriguing  problem of mobility transfer across cities, grasping the universal pat-  terns of human trajectories to augment the powerful Transformer  with external mobility data. There are two crucial challenges aris-  ing in the knowledge transfer across cities: 1) how to transfer the Transformer to adapt for domain heterogeneity; 2) how to calibrate  the Transformer to adapt for subtly different long-tail frequency distri-  butions of locations. To address these challenges, we have tailored a Cross-city mObiLity trAnsformer (COLA) with a dedicated model-  agnostic transfer framework by effectively transferring cross-city  knowledge for human trajectory simulation. Firstly, COLA divides  the Transformer into the private modules for city-specific character-  istics and the shared modules for city-universal mobility patterns. Secondly, COLA leverages a lightweight yet effective post-hoc ad-  justment strategy for trajectory simulation, without disturbing the  complex bi-level optimization of model-agnostic knowledge trans-  fer. Extensive experiments of COLA compared to state-of-the-art  single-city baselines and our implemented cross-city baselines have  demonstrated its superiority and effectiveness.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation

- Data
    - Download the Los Angeles dataset from [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1IPIgOj2xRO4SUSKccW5AvUIAoIlvD9J6/view?usp=share_link) and move it to `DeepTimeGeo/data/los_angeles/`

## üöÄ Running

- The model can be accssed at `python train_model.py`

- Please find the output at `trained_models/`. `asset/parse.ipynb` has the starter code to convert the rank-based representation back to geospatial data. Within `trained_models/`:
  - `data/` contains the processed rank-based representation of the trajectories. `training_set.pkl` contains trajectories used in training. `validation_set.pkl` contains users whose trajectories have been procssed but not used in training.
  - `simulation/` contains the completed trajectories. User `asset/parse.ipynb` to convert the rank-based representation back to original.
  - `viz/` contains basic visualizations of human moibility patterns in the sparse and the completed trajectories.
